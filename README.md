# chipwhisperer5-docker

A dockerized chipwhisperer 5 for easy installation. This is a fork of (https://github.com/nezza/chipwhisperer5-docker) with updated runtime and a docker-compose. It runs as user without --privileged.

## Disclaimer

This docker setup will bind to localhost:8888 with no password. I believe this is safe, but this behavior can be changed by commenting out a few lines in `chipwhisperer/startup.sh` and rebuilding the image. It might be to run the image as privileged when an access an access to `/dev/ttyACM0` is needed. Otherwise the device files in `/devacm/` can be used for APIs that allow setting a device file name.

## Install

To install, simply copy and load the newae udev rules and build the docker image:

```
sudo cp chipwhisper/99-newae.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
docker-compose build
```

## Run

```
docker-compose up
```

## Use

The Jupyter Notebook should then be running on port 8888. You can visit it by simply going to

http://127.0.0.1:8888/

The working directory will be initialized in workspace/ and will persist across updates or rebuilds. Labs require heavy modification of this directory, make sure you backup everything you want to keep.

## Full installation example:

```
sudo cp chipwhisper/99-newae.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
docker-compose up -d
```

## Docker-compose problems

Some older versions of docker-compose (such as in Ubuntu 20.04) have troubles with IPv6 addresses and docker-compose version 3. Use the alternate docker-compose script if needed.

```
cp docker-compose2.yml docker-compose.yml
```

## Jupyter Matplotlib

To use interactive plot in jupyter notebook
Add the following to the notebook cell and run

```
!pip install ipython ipympl nodejs-bin --break-system-package
!jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
!jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib
!jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

And add the interactive block with
```
%matplotlib widget
```

## Workspace can't be create

When the outer username isn't user, the workspace folder won't provide permission for the inner user to work with.
To get around this, chmod the workspace folder to provide write.

```
chmod 777 workspace
```
